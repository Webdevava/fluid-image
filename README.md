# Fluid Image Effect

This project demonstrates how to create a fluid image effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The image reacts to the movement of the mouse across the entire webpage, creating a fluid and dynamic effect.

## Usage

To use this effect on your own webpage, you can copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code from the `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files, respectively. Be sure to update the image source to your own desired image.

```html
<div class="fluid-container">
  <img src="your-image.jpg" class="fluid-image" alt="Your Image">
</div>
```
